# The Picture element

The `<picture>` HTML element contains zero or more `<source>` elements and one `<img>` element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.

## Examples

The browser will consider each child `<source>` element and choose the best match among them.
If no matches are found—or the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element—the URL of the `<img>` element's src attribute is selected.
The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the `<img>` element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>test</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>
<body>

<div style="width: 80%; height:full; margin:auto; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">

        <h2>The picture Element</h2>
        <div style="justify-content: space-around; margin: auto" >
            <div style="display:flexbox">
                <picture>
                    <source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="/static/images/huskies/326px-DOG-HUSKY_23JUL00.jpg">
                    <img src="/static/images/huskies/Huskiesatrest.jpg" style="width:auto;" alt="no image"/>
                </picture>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: rgb(92, 88, 103)" >
                <p>Resize the browser to see different versions of the picture loading at different viewport sizes.
                    The browser looks for the first source element where the media query matches the user's current viewport width,
                    and fetches the image specified in the srcset attribute.</p>

                    <p>The img element is required as the last child tag of the picture declaration block.
                    The img element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags matched.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The picture element is not supported in IE12 and earlier or Safari 9.0 and earlier.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
</div>


</body>
</html>

```

## The media attribute

The media attribute specifies a media condition (similar to a media query) that the user agent will evaluate for each `<source>` element.
If the `<source>`'s media condition evaluates to false, the browser skips it and evaluates the next element inside `<picture>`.

```
<picture>
  <source srcset="/static/images/huskies/Huskiesatrest640.jpeg" media="(min-width: 600px)" />
  <img src="/static/images/huskies/Huskiesatrest640.jpeg" alt="MDN" />
</picture>
```
